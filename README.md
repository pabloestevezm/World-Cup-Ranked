For this project we are going to take a dataset until 2014 (Brazil) and we are going to complete the dataset with information from the official web page of FIFA. In the data_clean file you can find some statistics numbers, apart of all the requests to get the info and the data cleaning of the dataset.

To show the complete information I'm going to update this in the future. 

This repository focuses on the World Cups of 1994,1998,2002,2006,2010,2014 because the 1994 WC was the first with rankings of the FIFA.

To execute the main.py file, you only need to open your terminal/git bash and write this command:

- python3 main.py -y (here you put the year from 1994 to 2014(4 years dif.)) -p (same but from 1-50)

The main.py will show you the matches that the specific position of the ranking played that WC, with some informationof that matches.



This repository isn't complete and if anyone wants to collaborate with is welcome!
